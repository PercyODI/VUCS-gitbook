# Store Front Project

## Goal
Using just HTML, build a store front mock up. Think about how you have seen other web store fronts set up (Amazon, eBay, WalMart, etc), and why they put certain things in certain places

## Requirements
1. An `index.html` file that will be the first page the user sees.
2. At least 5 different products to sell. 
    - Each product must have its own `.html` file
    - Each product needs at least one picture, shown on both `index.html` and the product's page
3. Each product must be on `index.html` with a link that takes the user to that product's page
4. Each product page must link back to `index.html`
5. Must make good use of HTML tags!
