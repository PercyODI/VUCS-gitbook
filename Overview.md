# Project Overview

The project we will be working on for the next few months is a new Jewlery Inventory web application for a friend. Currently, our friend uses an Excel spreadsheet to handle tracking their current inventory, including pictures, wholesale price, and list price. 

This project will require us to build a full web application from front to back. We will start with an admin page for our friend to interact with. They don't expect this page to be pretty, just functional.

Then we will hook this front-end to a back-end to provide more interactivity to the admin page.

After that, we will delve into databases so that the application will permanently store any data it has.

Finally we will be a nice customer facing front-end for people to search and purchase jewelry.
